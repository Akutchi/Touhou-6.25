Patchouli was reading book about magic - as always - when suddenly tiredness befell her.
While her consciousness was slowly fading, she closed her book and placed it at her right, on a large table.

P3 / - *yawn* I, I must be really tired, she murmured.

Mustering her last bit of remaning strength she unsummoned the spirit of light that served as her lamp
and fell asleep on the table.

First, there was darkness; but then came coldness.
A tremendous shiver ran down her spine as she opened her eyes again just to see that
she was falling in the sky.

M1 / - Wha.. !

Quickly regaining her composure, she casted a levitating spell and, just like a star in the night sky,
began to float again in the vast landscape that was present before her.
The now completely awake Patchouli then looked around her, she was outside the mansion.

M5 / - What happened, she wondered, was I not in the library just now ? How strange.

Recalling her past actions however she gasped,

M6 / - This book !? Do not tell me... I see how it is. I can't usally cast strong spell because of my health,
but being asleep is another story altogether.

Indeed, she had just read a book about body swapping that she had received recently
and happened to have casted the spell unconsciously.

M4 / - How amusing. Let's see now, with whom did I swapped body ?

She thus gave a good look at the body of the unfortunate person that was the vicitim of her spell.
Short blonde hair, a broom, and an outfit that made her look more like a maid than anything...
was it not Marisa ?

M4 / - He he, truly amusing... Said she once again before directing herself to the manor.
