Story :


----- Stage 1 [Introduction] :

Patchouli was reading book about magic - as always - when suddenly tiredness befell her. While her consciousness was slowly fading, she closed her book and placed it at her right, on a large table. 
 - _yawn_ I, I must be really tired, she murmured.
 Mustering her last bit of remaning strength she unsummoned the spirit of light that served as her lamp and fell asleep on the table.
 
 First, there was darkness; but then came coldness. 
 
 A tremendous shiver ran down her spine as she opened her eyes again just to see that she was falling in the sky,
 - Wha.. !
 Quickly regaining her composure, she casted a levitating spell and, just like a star in the night sky, began to float again in the vast landscape that was present before her. 
 The now completely awake Patchouli then looked around her, she was outside the mansion.
 - What happened, she wondered, was I not in the library just now ? How strange.
 Recalling her past actions however she gasped,
 - This book !? Do not tell me... I see how it is. I can't usally cast strong spell because of my health, but being asleep is another story altogether.
 Indeed, she had just read a book about body swapping that she had received recently and happened to have casted the spell unconsciously. 
 - How amusing. Let's see now, with whom did I swapped body ?
 She thus gave a good look at the body of the unfortunate person that was the vicitim of her spell. Short blonde hair, a broom, and an outfit that made her look more like a maid than anything... was it not Marisa ?
 - He he, how amusing...
 Said she before directing herself to the manor.
 
 Stage 1 [The ice Fairy] :
 
 Going on about her business, Patchouli encountered Cirno that was just passing by. The later began, 
 - You again ! This time for sure... !
 - (What did she do ?) Begone, I do not have time for the likes of you.
 - How presumptuous of you ! hmpf. You'll see !

[Battle start]

Beating Cirno, Patchouli exclaimed,
- Well then, maybe I had some reason to act this way, don't you think so too ?


----- Stage 2 [The imposter] :

Finally entering the mansion, and especially the library, Patchouli was greeted by a confused Marisa. It seemed she was pondering as to what she was doing here, and, when she saw herself, she got angry,
- You ! What did you do to me ?!
- I casted..
- It must be one of your scheme once again isn't it ?!
- Well...
- Do not play the fool !
- (Shall I play around with her ?)
- Well, you had me. Yes, it was my plan. How amusing to see how it played out so well. Aren't you amused too ?
- ...
- I'll have you know, it was not that simple of a spell to cast
- !!!, Prepare yourself ! I'll beat you to the ground !

[Battle Start]

- Ha ha ha, is that all that you have ?
_Sayaka enters_
- Patchouli can you come.. ? Playing again as I see.
- Playing ? Marisa answered with confusion
- Did I not tell you ? I casted a spell by accident.
- Hmppf, of course I knew this, I was just playing along.
 The akward Marisa could not contain her embarassement and changed the topic,
 - Anyway, just before we swapped body, I was going to subjugate some y√¥kai. Patchouli, take responsability and come with me !
 - Eh ? Why should I ? But, before that, shouldn't we exchange body once again ?


----- Stage 3 [The subjugation Of Yakumo Ran] :
