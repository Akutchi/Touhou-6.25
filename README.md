# Touhou-6.25

A fanmade Game about Touhou. It takes place between Touhou 6 and 7.

Story :

Patchouli was reading book about magic - as always - when suddenly tiredness befell her. While her consciousness was slowly fading, she closed her book and placed it at her right, on a large table. 
 - _yawn_ I, I must be really tired, she murmured.
 Mustering her last bit of strength, she unsummoned the spirit of light that served as her lamp and fell asleep on the table.
 
 First, there was darkness. But then came coldness. A tremendous shiver ran down her spine as she opened her eyes again, just to see that she was falling in the sky,
 - Wha.. !
 Quickly regaining her composure, she casted a levitating spell and began to float again in the vast sky that was present before her. The now completely awake Patchouli then looked around her, she was now outside the mansion.
